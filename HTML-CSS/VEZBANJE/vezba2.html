      The Skyline name originated from Prince automobile company, which
      developed and sold the Skyline line of sedans before merging with
      Nissan-Datsun. The original Skyline was launched by the Prince Motor
      Company in April 1957 and was powered by a 1.5-litre engine. The later
      iteration launched in 1964 called the Prince Skyline GT was powered by a
      2.0-litre G7 inline-6 engine shared with the up market Prince Gloria
      sedan. Two road going versions were built. The S54A which had a single
      carburettor engine rated at 78 kW (106 PS; 105 hp) and the S54B which had
      a triple carburettor engine rated at 92 kW (125 PS; 123 hp) and production
      totalled 100 units.[12]
